## TypeScript Programming

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality, readability, and maintainability, especially in large applications. This section covers core TypeScript features and object-oriented programming concepts.

### Topics Covered

- **Types**
  - Static type declarations: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `any`, `unknown`, `void`, `null`, `undefined`
  - Advanced types: `union`, `tuple`, `enum`
  - Type inference and type assertions

- **Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript**
  - Use of classes, interfaces, and access modifiers to model real-world objects
  - Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

- **Classes**
  - Define classes with `constructor`, methods, and properties
  - `readonly`, `static`, `private`, `protected`, and `public` members

- **Interfaces**
  - Define contracts for objects and classes
  - Support optional properties, function types, index signatures, and extensions

- **Access Modifiers**
  - `public`: Accessible from anywhere  
  - `private`: Accessible only within the class  
  - `protected`: Accessible within the class and its subclasses

- **Decorators**
  - Experimental feature used to annotate and modify classes, methods, properties
  - Common use cases: logging, validation, dependency injection

- **Exception Handling**
  - Use `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks to handle errors
  - Define and throw custom error classes for better debugging
    
- **File I/O (Input/Output)**
  - Node.js-based file system operations using the `fs` module
  - Reading and writing files asynchronously and synchronously
